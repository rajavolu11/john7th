00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,640
"Police Station, Maranelloor"
(Thiruvananthapuram District)

2
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,240
- Is the SI here? - He's gone out.
- Who's in charge? - The ASI.

3
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
<i>Hello...Maranelloor Police Station...</i>

4
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,120
Ok.

5
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
- I am here to see the SI*.
- Regarding? (*Sub-Inspector)

6
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
When will he be here?

7
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,480
Tell me what it's about.
They are all here to see the SI.

8
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
I...have served as the SI here...

9
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
-...some time ago.
- Oh.

10
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,680
Sir!

11
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
- I am on long leave at the moment.
- Oh.

12
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I need to examine a couple of documents.

13
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
From my period.

14
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,560
The Martin-Sheeba murder case.
Crime No. 252/17.

15
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Oh...I've heard of that.

16
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,160
The same year in September there was a
petty case of rash and negligent driving.

17
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,880
I need the man's address details -
he was called Chandran Pillai.

18
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,120
It was compounded for 184.

19
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
But such old files...

20
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,240
There should be a receipt book for TR5.
Or check the issue register.

21
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
- That isn't the issue, Sir.
It's a busy time. - I can wait.

22
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,920
You can sit inside while we look.
Please come this way.

23
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,600
Please sit, Sir.

24
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
We can't just hand over
the files to him, can we?

25
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
That's what I was thinking too.

26
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,200
- And didn't he say he is on leave?
- Yes.

27
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,240
Who knows what trouble he created
before going on leave?

28
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,160
- Let the SI get here.
Till then we can stall him. - Right.

29
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,000
<i>- He won't talk! - I don't know anything,
Sir - He will talk, Sir!</i>

30
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
<i>Go on! Talk!</i>

31
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,240
We're looking...but it might take a while.

32
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,080
Do you want me
to order tea or snacks for you?

33
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
There used to be a toddy shop
run by a man named Thampi.

34
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,160
They used to have good <i>appams</i> and curry.

35
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,400
- I'll go there and get something to eat.
- That isn't a toddy shop anymore.

36
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,240
When Thampi died,
his son turned it into a hotel.

37
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,440
What did you have?

38
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
One <i>parippuvada</i> and tea.

39
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,400
Oh! Sir! It's you!
I didn't recognise you at first.

40
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,080
- Are you back in the service?
- No.

41
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Oh...you were posted here
for seven or eight months, right?

42
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,560
Yes.

43
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,240
- How long since Thampi died?
- Almost a year.

44
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,440
- Oh...that's...not necessary.
- Just give me the change, man! - Ok!

45
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,000
I see your brother sometimes,
when he passes this way.

46
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Are you going to be around now?

47
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
- See you!
- Alright!

48
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We have done one round of searching.

49
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
Because it's from three years ago...

50
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,840
...I am wondering if that murder file...
was taken to the SP office.

51
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,800
And the rash driving one too...
we are not able to locate it.

52
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,280
It's one among a thousand....
you know how it is.

53
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
I could help if you want.

54
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
I am familiar with those shelves
and cupboards.

55
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
Sir!

56
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Is there a rule to salute
an SI who's on leave?

57
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
That was not a policeman's salute.

58
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
That's him, isn't it?

59
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,760
When you left, I got lucky!
I got this guy!

60
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,720
Here.

61
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
<i>Our dearest candidate....</i>

62
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,000
<i>...Sudhakaran Sreevalsam, contesting
on the electoral symbol, the Almirah...</i>

63
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,080
<i>...humbly seeks your vote.</i>

64
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,120
<i>Give another chance to the hero of
development for our land...</i>

65
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,800
<i>...so that Sudhakaran Sreevalsam can
continue the action plans he initiated...</i>

66
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,440
<i>Grant him each of your valuable votes...</i>

67
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,280
- <i>...and lead him to victory...
we request you!</i> - Come, Sir.

68
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
<i>Our symbol...the Almirah!</i>

69
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,240
<i>Our candidate...Sudharakan Sreevalsam!</i>

70
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,320
<i>As our land reels under...</i>

71
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,920
<i>...corruption, looting and inflation...</i>

72
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,640
<i>...let us give a fitting reply
to the ruling party...</i>

73
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
<i>...with our dear candidate...</i>

74
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
<i>...our own Advocate...</i>
- Hold this. - Ok.

75
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
<i>...Ashokan Kizhakkedam...
contesting under the symbol...</i>

76
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,120
<i>...the chair.
We humbly request each one of you...</i>

77
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,200
<i>...to grant him your votes.</i>

78
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
- Give it to me, Sir.
- Here.

79
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
- Take it out!
- Here.

80
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Hold! Yes.

81
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Pour it...pour!

82
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Marar Cheta*! (*Brother)

83
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,720
Right in the eye!

84
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,760
Oh! Is that you, Sir! What happened?
Anything wrong with your bike?

85
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
It's nothing...my purse fell out
of my pocket...I found it!

86
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,840
Sir...I got some great Murrel fish!
Fresh caught from the stream!

87
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Shall I bring some to your place?

88
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
No, man...

89
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,120
I mean...you said the kids liked it
last time...

90
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,000
Tell me if you are going home...
I can bring some to your quarters.

91
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Get out of the way!

92
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
Sir...as usual, after he was done
for the day...

93
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,280
...he parked his auto at home
and came here.

94
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
He had a bottle and left.

95
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,680
- Where to?
- Well..

96
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,240
...he usually goes home from here.

97
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,520
That night he came again.
Around closing time.

98
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
And drank four more bottles.

99
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,200
And when you asked where he was going,
he said Martin Sir's house.

100
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
He is a nice guy, Sir...

101
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Never been anything but helpful.

102
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,920
He and his sister only have each other.

103
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,000
And her marriage is more or less fixed.

104
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,760
We've been hearing you still mix
Diazepam with the toddy here.

105
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,400
There's an old case on that.
It's not closed yet.

106
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
It could resurface any time.

107
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,440
<i>Maranelloor's action-oriented leader...</i>

108
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,560
<i>...Sudhakaran Sreevalsam....whom we know
and who knows us...</i>

109
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,560
<i>...seeks your valuable votes...
on his electoral symbol, the Almirah.</i>

110
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,080
<i>Lead him to victory, we request you...
we beseech you...</i>

111
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,320
<i>For welfare schemes
to reach the deserving...</i>

112
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,640
<i>...and the overall development
of our land...</i>

113
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,160
<i>...the one we know...
the one who knows us...</i>

114
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
<i>...Comrade Sudhakaran Sreevalsam...</i>

115
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,120
<i>...seeks your valuable vote...
on the electoral symbol, the Almirah...</i>

116
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,040
<i>Lead him to victory, we request you....
we beseech you...</i>

117
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,520
(Election campaigning continues)

118
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
Drop me here.

119
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Marar Sir, do you want me to wait?

120
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
- No.
- Alright then.

121
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Give me a cigarette.

122
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,840
<i>Spreading rumours
about the law and order situation...</i>

123
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,920
<i>...is how the Opposition candidate
is trying to gain votes.</i>

124
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>Let them examine...</i>

125
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,640
<i>...the crime records
from my five years as MLA.</i>

126
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,240
<i>The number of criminal cases
that used to range in ten thousands...</i>

127
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,000
<i>...has dropped to half in our constituency.</i>

128
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
<i>On the basis of one case of double-murder
that remains unsolved...</i>

129
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,640
<i>...he is trying to project that there
is some sort of dangerous atmosphere here.</i>

130
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,520
<i>My respected friend from the Opposition!</i>

131
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,200
<i>If we are are the ones in power,
we will have that case solved.</i>

132
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
<i>Using the same police force
that you described as...</i>

133
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,560
<i>...useless and impotent!</i>

134
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,400
(Protesters shouting)
<i>Where, where, police...!</i>

135
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,240
<i>...is the Martin-Sheeba murderer?</i>

136
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,680
<i>Where is the Martin-Sheeba murderer?</i>

137
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,440
<i>"We want justice.
Police, do your job!"</i>

138
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,600
(Slogan shouting continues)

139
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,920
Three weeks after the murders,
the Police...

140
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,640
...have made no progress, have they, Sir?

141
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Move aside!

142
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,680
- I said, move aside! - Don't play tough
with us...we know how to get you!

143
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,280
- Is the DySP here? - Yes. And there was
a small issue at the gate.

144
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,360
A slight tussle when Ajith Sir arrived...
they threw away his hat...

145
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,440
Check the exit polls...
it's not what it was two weeks ago!

146
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,720
I am the one suffering
for your inefficiency!

147
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,840
And with the events today, more people will
know! The entire media is out there!

148
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,760
Only two more weeks to the election...
if you can't handle this, tell me!

149
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,840
I will bring in policemen
who know their job!

150
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,320
Bunch of useless fellows
scrambling in the dark!

151
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,800
Has anyone made the slightest progress?

152
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,920
I want results! Not next week
or the week after that!

153
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,240
- <i>In two days! Understand? All of you?</i>
- Who are they? - They've left.

154
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
They were specially brought in
to create trouble.

155
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
They belong to "Blade" Rangan's gang.

156
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,200
- The one we picked up from the bar last
week? - He and Danny.

157
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Both must be in the Party office now.

158
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
They think we wouldn't go in there.

159
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,640
Move...you p****!

160
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,000
I will be back
to get you for assaulting the DySP.

161
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,360
This is for daring to touch my brother!

162
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,440
(DySP Ajith singing)

163
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
- Here you go!
- Nice cake!

164
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
- Go on..give!
- Hey! Give some to Ananthu!

165
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,360
He's been waiting for a while!

166
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
- Here. - Thank you!
- Hello, Sir?

167
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
- Now slice it up.
- Don't get it on your clothes, please!

168
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,360
- You already gave him some!
- Hey! Hold on!

169
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,520
- Love you! - Give him a piece, Malu!
- Yes, Sir.

170
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,360
Sir, we got information about goons hiding
in the Party office. That's why he went.

171
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,040
When they got violent...
he acted in self-defence...

172
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
That....yes, I'll warn him.

173
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,640
I will warn him...yes, Sir!

174
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,160
About that...as I said, Sir...

175
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
...there has been
no slowing down on our side.

176
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,480
We're making sure the evidence is solid...

177
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
...given that it's a case of murder.

178
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,040
It's him, Sir...we have no doubts
about that.

179
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,600
We just need to be a bit more prepared
before moving to an arrest.

180
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,360
No Sir...no delays....I got that, Sir!

181
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Sir? Yes...

182
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Yes, Sir...surely, Sir.

183
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Sir...but...Sir...that's what we...

184
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
What's the story?

185
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,440
Last April 13th, at 11.30 in the night...

186
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,760
...the accused auto driver arrived at
the toddy shop run by a man named Thampi.

187
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,800
He drank excessively.

188
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Don't drive in this state...
I will drop you.

189
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
- I am not going home. - Where else
are you going so late in the night?

190
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,400
- Thampi Cheta! - Yes?
- I made all preparations for the wedding.

191
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,280
I found the best possible groom
for my sister.

192
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,800
Before agreeing to the terms from
the groom's side...

193
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,600
...I told that son-of-a-b*** I need
Rs.75,000...

194
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,520
...to seal the deal.

195
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,360
It was only on the strength
of his promise...

196
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,040
- ...that I went forward with it. You know
that too, don't you? - Yes.

197
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,720
And now the bloody b*** says...

198
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
-...he can't give me the money!
- Who? Martin Sir?

199
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Yes! If I don't pay
the agreed amount tomorrow...

200
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
...the wedding will be off! But I will not
let him live in peace...

201
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
....after wrecking my plans!

202
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Whatever it is,
you shouldn't go there right now.

203
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey! Hey! Shit!

204
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
The suspect went straight
to Martin's house.

205
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
They got into an argument
about the money.

206
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,600
I need the Rs.75,000 you promised tomorrow!

207
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,640
- I have to conduct my sister's wedding.
- I have made no such promise.

208
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,800
- I only said we will see at the time.
- You said go ahead and set the date.

209
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,080
If that's not a promise,
what is it, you dog?

210
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,120
Losing control over himself,
he caught Martin by the neck...

211
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,240
...and started banging his head
against the wall.

212
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,440
Martin lost his balance and fell.
Sheeba was frightened....

213
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
...and started screaming.

214
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
Murali took out the pepper spray
he had been hiding...

215
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,640
...and sprayed it on her face.

216
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,320
She lost her footing and fell to the floor.

217
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,040
When Martin tried to stand, he too...

218
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
...was sprayed by Murali.

219
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,120
As Martin lay on the floor...

220
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,680
...Murali took out the long spiral
screwdriver he had with him...

221
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,880
...and stabbed him in the chest.

222
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,080
By then Sheeba who was trying to get up...

223
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,560
...was also stabbed
twice in the chest by Murali.

224
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Thereafter, he locked the house
from the outside...

225
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,280
...dragged both bodies to the backyard...

226
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,560
...and buried them there.

227
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,840
A dead cat was rotting in the same area...

228
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,840
...and so the stench of the dead bodies
was not immediately noticed.

229
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
So, it was two days after the murder...

230
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,520
...on getting a complaint from Martin's
brother that they were missing...

231
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,720
...that the dead bodies were discovered.

232
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
By then, many vital bits of evidence
were lost.

233
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
Martin's phone was also not recovered.

234
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,000
The suspect himself destroyed
some of the evidence.

235
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Sir...this is the story.

236
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,080
But...what about the boy Martin got
dismissed from his college?

237
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,040
He's still a strong suspect. And I've asked
him to come in for questioning tomorrow.

238
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,160
He's a suspect, yes. But not a strong one.

239
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,320
That is a motive that we can suggest,
that's all.

240
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,440
- There isn't a bit of evidence against
him. - And that's not all, Sir...

241
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,080
The fact that Martin had promised
some money...

242
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,200
...for Murali's sister's wedding
is already there in his first statement.

243
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,000
He backed out in the last minute.
And the wedding was called off.

244
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,080
Over the money issue!

245
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
That is also a motive we are suggesting.

246
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
Murali was an insider in that household.

247
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,320
That is clear from the statements given
by him as well as others.

248
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,480
And Sheeba used to go around in his auto
for shopping and such.

249
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
He knows every corner of that house.

250
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
That was also in Martin's
brother's statement.

251
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,480
Another thing...the bodies of both
deceased had puncture wounds.

252
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,000
Which means the weapon used...

253
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,480
...most probably...was a long spiral
screwdriver.

254
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,080
The kind that an auto driver like Murali
will definitely have.

255
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,440
- Hmmm - But there was absolutely no
discrepancy in his statement.

256
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,160
- Nothing suspicious!
- If you start believing all that...

257
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I did not feel that he was lying.
I recorded his statement myself.

258
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,760
We can't go with feelings anymore.
We need to provide answers.

259
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,880
I know. But does that mean...

260
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
...we can create those answers
ourselves, Sir?

261
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,240
Ok

262
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,600
- Alright then...see you later!
- Are you going back to quarters today?

263
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,640
- Uncle isn't going anywhere today! Am I
right? - I see!

264
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,360
- I'll leave in the morning, Cheta. - Ok!
- We could go tomorrow too! - Right!

265
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,560
- What about school?
-  I have 4 surgeries...

266
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,360
...posted for tomorrow...
or else we could've stayed!

267
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
That's nothing new, is it?

268
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,280
- Ok, Ok! - Ok, Cheta!
- Alright then! - Bye!

269
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,760
- Bye! - Bye!

270
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,880
- Come along now! - You never visit us
anymore! The kids have been complaining!

271
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,600
- I've only recently joined the service!
- Doesn't mean you can't make a visit!

272
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,320
- See you! Isn't the hearing for
that child abuse case on 23rd? - Yes

273
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,480
- I'll see you then, ok?
- Heard that?

274
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
- What? - He is talking about roasting
us alive in Court!

275
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
- Really!
- Stop that!

276
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
You are the only reason
he wasn't granted bail.

277
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
- Loosen the grip this time, please!
- Sure I will!

278
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
- Alright then! - Bye!
- Bye!

279
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,360
- Bye! - Goodnight!
- Bye, Uncle!

280
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
- So what's the plan?
- Let's play Ludo.

281
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
- Good idea!
- Hey! You!

282
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,240
Come.

283
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,040
- I'll be right back.
- Dad! We were going to play!

284
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,880
Like that's going to happen! You are both
going to listen to that little devil now!

285
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,360
"Cobra! Panther! Zebra!" Uggh!

286
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
- Delta 1 answering.
- <i>Delta 1 Control</i>

287
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
<i>Sir, instructions from the Tiger....</i>

288
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,040
<i>...to inspect hotels in the tourist area...</i>

289
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,080
<i>-...and other related places.</i>
- Clear!

290
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Roger!

291
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,480
- What's going on with your car plans?
- Haven't decided yet.

292
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
I did a couple of test drives.

293
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,120
Get a Swift. It is suitable for your needs.

294
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,600
Alright.

295
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,920
(Messages coming in over the wireless)

296
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,640
None of them...are bad officers.

297
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,760
They are 100% convinced it was Murali.

298
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
And not just them...me too.

299
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,440
Without that belief, we wouldn't just
frame an innocent.

300
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Neither them. Nor me.

301
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
I did not say that, Cheta.

302
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
I...

303
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,200
When I decided to give up Law
and join the service...

304
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,600
...I had promised myself I would be
a good police officer.

305
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
And you were my model in coming
to that decision.

306
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,920
It was you I learned from.

307
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,080
Or I could have just been comfortable
farming the lands Dad left me.

308
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
But this...

309
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
...I am very confused.

310
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,680
When I was SI in Kovalam...a man
harassed a child and stabbed him to death.

311
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,880
We got the guy. But the Court let him go.

312
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,240
You know why? "The Police were unable
to recover the knife used for stabbing."

313
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,440
How could we? After the murder,
he threw the knife into the sea.

314
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
He walked free!

315
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
And I was transferred to Traffic.

316
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,440
The Additional SI Haneefa
tried to convince me...

317
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,920
...to plant a knife
in place of the original.

318
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,680
I refused and ended up the fool!

319
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,120
That was the day I decided...
that our careers should not suffer...

320
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,760
...because of some criminal's master plan!

321
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
If the ruling Party loses this election...

322
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
...none of us will remain in this district.

323
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Our power is only in the uniform.

324
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,680
No rascal will turn up to protect us.

325
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,640
But...without being sure it is him...

326
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
It is definitely him!
The circumstantial evidence...

327
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,680
...motive...none of it is as strong
for any of the other suspects.

328
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,440
You are caught in the trap
of his innocence act.

329
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,040
That itself is a sign
of a hardened criminal!

330
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Don't be foolish!

331
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Experience! That counts for a lot
in a policeman!

332
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
There is a 6th sense you acquire
through it.

333
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
And that is not just an inference.

334
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,400
In maybe....five years...
you will also start getting it!

335
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
You can go on learning from me.

336
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
You won't go wrong!

337
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,480
- What is it, Chechi*? (*Sister)
- The SP had  called three or four times.

338
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,760
Your brother is fast asleep...
he's had a little too much drink today.

339
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,520
You know how he is when he gets tense.

340
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,800
And now...look...he has sent a message
as well.

341
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,720
It seems there is some march or commotion
planned at the SP office tomorrow....

342
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,440
There was a report from the Special
Branch about it, apparently.

343
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,360
It is related to that murder case.

344
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I'll wake him up if it's an emergency.

345
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,480
It's ok...let him sleep. You can go to bed
too. I'll take care of this.

346
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
I'll take care of it!

347
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,880
Pramod...

348
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,120
You go and discreetly get him here.

349
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
He trusts you.

350
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,560
Murali!

351
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh! Is that you, Sir? Why are you here
at this time?

352
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,000
- Come on in, Sir.
- Come over here, please. - Huh?

353
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,200
Sir...

354
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,560
Come...

355
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
- Come here, man...come on...
- What is this about, Sir?

356
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
We need to ask you a couple of questions.

357
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
- What about, Sir?
- Just come.

358
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,360
- Just walk on. - Come here!
- Marar Sir!

359
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
- Tell them to let me go! Sir!
- Get a hold of him! - Get into the jeep!

360
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,600
- Get in! - Don't make a fuss!
- Let me go, Sir! - I said, get in!

361
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
- Get in!
- Stay still, will you?

362
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,920
- Listen! Murali!
- Sir...please...

363
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
- Why are you doing this, Sir?
- Don't make me hit you!

364
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,520
But what did I....Sir...what did I do?

365
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,880
Sir...

366
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,160
- Sir...my sister is all alone! - Stop
moving! - Where are you taking me?

367
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Sir what did I do?

368
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,520
- Sir...please...let me at least
tell my sister! - Sit still!

369
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Come!

370
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Come on...

371
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,640
- Why are we here, Sir?
- Walk. Walk!

372
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,440
Climb up. Now stop.

373
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Come...let me get in first...

374
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,160
- No one should be able to make out
how old the wound is -Ok

375
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Hey! Hey! Shhh!

376
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Don't make noise!

377
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Stop making noise!

378
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Walk on!

379
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
I said, don't move!

380
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,120
- Stay still! - You hold this.
- Walk this way!

381
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
- Stand straight...stand straight!
And be quiet! - Come on!

382
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,440
Come here, you!

383
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,480
I said, come!

384
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Come...don't push back...

385
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,920
- Walk on! - I said, don't push back!
- Pramod...

386
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,720
- Hold his hand!
- Walk on!

387
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,920
- Walk - Stop that!
- Come on!

388
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,320
Come on! Hold it! Hold!

389
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
Show the light properly, Sir!

390
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,000
Don't fight back!

391
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,480
- Put your  hand on it!
- Hold! - Come on, hold!

392
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
- Put your hand here!
- Hold!

393
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,480
Hold! Come on!

394
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,560
- Hold! - Hold it!

395
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
- Sir! - You...!

396
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,520
"Arrest the culprit
in the Martin-Sheeba murders"

397
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
<i>Now talk and don't leave out a word!</i>

398
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,080
<i>Or you will hang upside down here!</i>

399
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,680
<i>Where did you hide it? Speak!</i>

400
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,760
- I don't know anything, Sir! - Stop, Sir..
he will talk...Murali...come on!

401
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,840
You were seen that night
in the Puthenpadam area.

402
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,440
- I don't know anything, Sir!
- If you hid it there, just tell us!

403
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,200
- Tie him up!
- No, Sir...come on...

404
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
- Talk! - Sir...sir...he will talk!

405
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Stop it, you!

406
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,440
- My dear Murali...<i>you don't have to
get beaten up like this! - But I...</i>

407
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
<i>-...know nothing!
- Here...have some water!</i>

408
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,920
<i>And start talking...around the
Puthenpaadam area...</i>

409
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,440
<i>...try to recollect...</i>

410
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
<i>Go on...drink!</i>

411
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Sir...we...

412
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
He is Nikhil...Martin Sir's student...

413
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
We were asked to come...

414
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Our bus reached here a little early.

415
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,000
You may go.

416
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,440
- I said you may go!
- Ok

417
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
<i>Let us have a go at him, Sir!</i>

418
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,640
<i>Allow us to handle him!</i>

419
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,680
(Crowd hurls abuses at Murali)

420
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
- Look around.
- Was it somewhere here?

421
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Sir...got it!

422
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,440
Hey! Who did that? Hey!

423
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Cover up!

424
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,720
Don't throw!

425
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,400
- Hold them back! - Move them!
- Bring the car around!

426
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
Move away, all of you!

427
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,440
Dear constituents!
The beloved son of this soil...

428
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,760
<i>...Comrade Sudhakaran Sreevalsam...
is coming to you in the vehicle behind.</i>

429
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,560
- Move! I said, move!
<i>He wants to thank you...</i>

430
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,280
<i>...in person for every precious vote
you cast for him. Our beloved Comrade...</i>

431
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,120
<i>...is coming to thank you personally.</i>

432
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,480
<i>Comrade Sudhakaran...
beloved son of the soil..</i>

<i>...who is always with us...</i>

434
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
<i>...our own Comrade...</i>

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Please stand closer.

436
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Ok....ready, sir?

437
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
- Go on - I want you to take it, Cheta.
Yes!

438
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,800
- Congrats! - Congrats!
- Thanks, Cheta!

439
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,560
Please drive, Cheta.
I want you to drive it first!

440
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,400
<i>Move!</i>

441
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
It's good...nice pick-up.

442
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,880
So congrats! At least now you don't have to
bear the sun on that bike!

443
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Oh no! He is my first love!

444
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,600
I took an evening job and gave tuitions
for the money to buy it!

445
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,760
No way I am giving him up!

446
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,280
- This is only for occasional use.
- The colour selection is great anyhow.

447
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,360
- True!
- And the leg space is great too.

448
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,240
- But you should've bought a bigger car.
- I had actually booked a Benz.

449
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,720
- They didn't have the right colour! - Ugh!
- I am wondering how I'll pay for this!

450
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,440
You should have connections
with the liquour barons.

451
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,800
- To boost your income!
- Hey! Hey!

452
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,240
You should think twice
before saying stuff at home!

453
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,320
Hmm! You are taking this
to your quarters, right?

454
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,720
Yes...but I have promised to drop them
to school and college tomorrow.

455
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
I'll leave after that.

456
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
But I am wondering if Madam
would accept a ride in this small car.

457
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Guess so!

458
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Ride aside...you need to give us a treat!

459
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,840
- What is it, Pramod?
- A lavish lunch maybe? - Ya, that'll do!

460
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,440
Ok

461
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,120
We were on night patrolling
in the Tirumala area last night.

462
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,720
That's when this vehicle came along...
a Duster* (*SUV)

463
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,120
We could tell at first glance
that the guy was drunk.

464
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,560
When we asked him for his personal
info, his answers were vague.

465
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,400
I started to suspect that the car
might have been stolen.

466
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,080
I asked him to step outside
and did a search of the interior.

467
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
That's when we came across
this pepper spray in the dashboard.

468
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,480
Also...

469
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,120
...this. I had a doubt...

470
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,240
...so I switched it on
and dialled my own number on it.

471
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Turns out it is the dead Martin's number.

472
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,640
This is the missing phone, Sir!

473
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
I pocketed it without his knowledge.

474
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,640
- And the man? - I slapped him with a petty
case for rash driving and let him go.

475
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
You let him go?

476
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,600
- Who else was on the team?
- Only I dealt with him.

477
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,360
When I got suspicious, I turned away
the others to check other vehicles.

478
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,880
- Was he anyone on our suspect list?
- No, Sir.

479
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,560
His name is Chandran Pillai.
At least that's what the license said.

480
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,520
Did you mention anything about this case?
Did he hint at something?

481
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,560
No, Sir...I did not ask
any leading questions.

482
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,320
- If it led to a confession....
- If it led to a confession...

483
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,320
-...we could've taken him into custody!
- And after taking him into custody?

484
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,880
The mobile that went missing
from the crime scene was recovered!

485
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,120
And the pepper spray
that was part of the modus operandi!

486
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,440
The trial is  going on in the Sessions
Court...witness examinations almost done..

487
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,640
We have no more role in this!

488
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,880
What explanation can we give for the
evidence we presented against Murali?

489
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,520
He has been in jail for three and a half
months...who will take up responsibility?

490
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,360
"We made a mistake...
please forgive us!"...

491
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,680
...you think we can say that and the
matter will be resolved?

492
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,200
We'll have to give up the Khakhi and go to
jail...you, me and everyone in this room!

493
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,160
So what should we do now, Sir?
You, me and everyone in this room?

494
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,120
Some person was charged with a petty case
of rash and negligent driving.

495
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
No one needs to be bothered by him
any more than that.

496
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
- So what about Murali?
- Let him be released.

497
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,520
- We will do something for him then.
- That's right, Sir.

498
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,120
This could hurt us if we interfere.
Let us forget this right here right now!

499
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,160
And the next time a crime occurs...
and there is political pressure...

500
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,400
...we frame the next guy who comes along,
is that it, Marar Cheta?

501
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,800
That's how the system works...
for your information!

502
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,200
As long as there are ministers
and politics and elections...

503
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,080
...it's not going to change!

504
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,160
- If not the five of us, it will be another
five! - It shouldn't be the five of us!

505
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,400
- At least not five that includes me!
- You alone can't take that decision!

506
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,640
I can! If only one of us has a spine,
he alone can decide!

507
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,760
Let the guy with the spine
find some evidence first!

508
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,920
Go on!

509
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,800
Get out!

510
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,400
We had collected some hair strands from
the crime scene...and fingerprints too...

511
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,480
Martin used to give tuitions...so there
were many students walking in and out...

512
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,920
Maybe guests as well...
all those possibilities...

513
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
...I had discussed with Alex Sir.

514
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,840
Other than Murali's, there was no DNA
that matched any other suspect?

515
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,600
No...and once it was established
that it was Murali...

516
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,080
...nothing else was relevant anymore...
and also...

517
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,080
...the only other blood stains we found
at the crime scene were Murali's.

518
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
But why all this, Sir? Any problem?

519
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,600
- Nothing. It's just a small clarification.
That's all. - Ok.

520
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,360
This is sensitive information. Don't
go around discussing it with anyone.

521
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,080
- Sir, do you want me to put it in writing?
- Not at the moment.

522
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,560
Let me take a look at it. This also...

523
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
...involves your brother.

524
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,080
Ajith! Speak of the devil!

525
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,320
Looks like the devils
are out to get me, Sir!

526
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,600
Not as long as I am around!

527
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,440
- Come, Alex...sit! - Yes, Sir!
- You may leave!

528
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,360
Hey! You tempted me
with a 100-year vintage...

529
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,880
I waited so long at the club
with Baby Sir!

530
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,920
It was late after the security meet, Sir!

531
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,480
Today, for sure!

532
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
- Sir?
- Please come back for a second.

533
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,800
Sir!

534
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,520
The IG's wife and kids are here
on a two-day visit.

535
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
Take them around wherever they want to go.

536
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
They are not familiar with the place.

537
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,720
(Guide describing the musuem to visitors)

538
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,440
- Sorry, I was in a meeting.
- Ok.

539
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,120
- Myself, Divakara Menon, Musuem manager
- Hello.

540
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,000
- IG Sir hasn't come? - No, Baba...
I have a very busy husband!

541
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,320
- Oh! - He has sent someone
to escort us and escaped!

542
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,040
- Please let me know if you need anything.
- Sure!

543
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
- Enjoy yourself!
- Excuse me...where is the toilet?

544
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,560
- It's over there, ma'am...corridor-end...
left side. - Ok

545
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,680
- Namaste, ma'am! - Ok!
- Please take him.

546
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,320
(Guide continues description)
- It's there...on the left side.

547
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,680
Why? Why can't you take him?

548
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,280
You go with him.

549
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,040
<i>Control Tiger! B12 SI- please come on
the set.</i>

550
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,920
- B12 SI answering, Sir. - The Odisha
Chief Justice is arriving at 5 pm.

551
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,600
- You will be his escort. - The driver is
on leave in the afternoon, Sir.

552
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Why? Can't you drive?

553
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,480
If there is no driver, you drive yourself.
That's the rule. Didn't you know?

554
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,440
Or do you want to me give you
a written order to that effect?

555
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,760
Pick him up at the airport...
take him wherever he has meetings...

556
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,640
...and be with him right till he gets to
his accommodation after dinner.

557
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,800
However late that might be.

558
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
Ashamed to drive, are you? Fool!

559
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,280
Your job is to obey! Get it?

560
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,280
Answer me!

561
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
B12 - can you hear me?

562
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,440
B12 - answer me!

563
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,360
Before the Chief of Police of the
state of Kerala...

564
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,160
...the Sub-Inspector of Maranelloor
Police Station...

565
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,840
...I, Aravind Karunakaran, as per due
process, do submit this application.

566
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,160
Sir...for personal and family reasons...

567
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,360
...and to carry out some unavoidable
responsibilities...from 4.10.2017...

568
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,680
...for a period of 5 years, I wish to avail
leave without pay...

569
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,160
...and request you to do the needful.

570
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,880
- Hey, Ashish! - Over there!
- Ok!

571
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,080
Aravind!

572
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,200
What's this, man! I've been looking
everywhere for you!

573
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,480
- I told you it's the last day of sale.
- Coming!

574
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,680
And listen, there's also this
lovely sofa set on sale.

575
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Should we check it out?

576
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,840
No way! All I have is 6000 in my account.

577
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,600
- That's it!
- Hmm...let me see.

578
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,160
Ok...I'll use my credit card...
but it's on both of us, ok?

579
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,080
Ok!

580
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,440
It's Malu, isn't it?

581
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,040
A little left...

582
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,240
- ...little more...
- Ya!

583
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,240
Perfect!

584
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,280
- That'll give us more space.
- Ok.

585
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Thank you.

586
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
So...what do you think?

587
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,640
Great! Didn't I tell you we needed
a sofa set?

588
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,640
Hmm...you're right!
I would never have thought of that!

589
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,240
Genius!

590
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
- Coffee?
- Of course!

591
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,560
By the way, Sitaram Sir said
the moot court is next month.

592
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
It'll be Firoze and me most probably.

593
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,920
Right...he's always partial towards you!

594
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,080
And it has nothing to do
with merit, right?

595
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Come on, Aravind!

596
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,440
I am not ready, Dia.

597
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,600
Ok...I can understand that
about others...but...

598
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,120
...why include Malu in that?

599
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
She is also a reminder of that past.

600
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
I don't want to go there.

601
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,880
I am somehow trying to move on.

602
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Two years, Aravind!

603
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,840
For now, I just want to complete
the course.

604
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Everything else can wait.

605
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
Do you have a problem?

606
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,480
I do have a problem.

607
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,440
Go on!

608
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,800
- Please don't cut the call, Uncle.
- Hey...you!

609
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,720
- I am getting married, Uncle!
- What?

610
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,840
- Married? You?
- The way you react...

611
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,680
-...one would think I was saying
that I eloped! - Who is...

612
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,520
-...the unfortunate?
- I'll tell you...but in person.

613
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
October 2nd is the engagement...
and November 4th the wedding.

614
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,680
You'll come, won't you, Uncle?

615
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,560
Let's see. It's three months away!

616
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,280
Dad wants to talk to you.

617
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
- Here.
- Ok.

618
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,600
It's me.

619
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
There's a lot to be done.

620
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,640
Be here at least two weeks in advance.

621
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
I can't do everything myself.

622
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,040
You...

623
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,680
...will come, won't you?

624
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
Cheta...when I come,
there'll be someone with me.

625
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
When you say partner...

626
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,240
...are you running a business there
along with your studies?

627
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Listen kids...all of you can go inside.

628
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,640
It's 10.30...time for bed!

629
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,720
- Bye! - Bye!

630
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
- I meant you too!
- But I...

631
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
Live-in relationship...ever heard of it?

632
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,760
- Great selection!
- Thanks!

633
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,720
I guess we should also go to bed...
he must be tired after the long drive.

634
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,280
- Sister-in-law...ask...ask!
- Hold on...I will!

635
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,640
After you left, Nandu dumped his cycle
and cricket set in that room.

636
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,440
- Shall I make a bed for you there? - It's
ok, Chechi...we'll just use this room.

637
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
- I'll get it, Cheta.
- Ok.

638
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,640
Good night! Come!

639
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,720
<i>Delta 1.
Delta 1 reporting and over.</i>

640
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,360
<i>Sir...as per instructions...the suspect
has been traced, Sir</i>

641
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,160
I want the file on that cheating case
in my office tomorrow.

642
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,280
<i>Message received. It's clear, Sir.
Over.</i>

643
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,520
What I missed the most were these sounds.

644
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,360
- She's with the Times, isn't she?
- Yes, in HR.

645
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,120
- Sit.
- We are together in the evening class.

646
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,760
That's how we met.

647
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,880
It's because she has a job
that I can manage.

648
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,240
Hmm...and her parents?

649
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,720
They're in Pune. Her father is a Flight Lt.
in the Air Force.

650
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,880
- I've met him. - Let me know
when I should officially meet him.

651
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,640
<i>Delta 1...Delta 1, B1 answering, Sir...
seven cases...</i>

652
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,640
<i>-...have been executed.</i>
- You have too many pending cases.

653
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,000
- Pay attention to process. - Cheta...
may I? <i>- Clear, Sir. Over.</i>

654
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,360
Ok. And also...

655
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,600
...the exact reasons for your taking
leave and staying away...

656
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,680
...are not known to anyone here.
Not even Radhika.

657
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,760
You took a break when the pressures
of the job got too much for you.

658
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,880
That's what I've told them.

659
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,640
Ok.

660
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,280
Here...let me see that...what do you think?

661
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,400
I think a jasmine bud design
will look better on her.

662
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,040
- Can you show me one of those?
- Yes, Madam.

663
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,120
How about we get a ''thali*" made?
(*wedding pendant)

664
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
- What?
- You know..."thali"?

665
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,640
- What you call "mangalsutra".
- For whom?

666
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,200
I mean...we should have a small ceremony...

667
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,120
...to make it official.

668
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,920
Now it's like...
you aren't really married...

669
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,000
...but in a way....you are!

670
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,160
What do we tell Malu's groom's family?

671
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,240
How do we explain who you are?

672
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,320
- Sir, tea. - No, thank you, son! You gave
me one yourself an hour ago.

673
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,200
Aren't you...Murali's...?

674
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,880
Sir, I beg of you...please don't tell
anyone here who I am.

675
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,640
If they come to know I am Murali's
sister, I'll be fired from this job too!

676
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,280
I don't suppose you heard.

677
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,440
The verdict on the appeal came the day
before...my brother's life sentence...

678
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,880
...was confirmed by the High Court.

679
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,040
Are you satisfied now?

680
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,000
I have no home now...we sold it
for the sake of the case.

681
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,200
But our little house was not enough...

682
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,240
...to defeat big guys like you!

683
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,920
I am too scared to die...so I have to live.

684
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,240
Please don't harm me anymore!

685
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,480
- Liked it? - Yes.
- Can you show me that one?

686
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,760
- Here you go, Madam.
- Oh...

687
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,120
Whether you did it for a medal
or a promotion...

688
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,520
...or even just for survival...
whatever your reason was...

689
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,760
...it cannot take the place
of the skies I should've seen...

690
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,160
...and the winds I should've been
able to feel!

691
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
It cannot be greater
than my sister's future!

692
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,480
Or the family I could've had.

693
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,440
Please go, Sir...go and live a happy life.

694
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,440
When I met Joseph Sir
he was talking about you.

695
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:08,760
The promotion list will be out soon.
It's between you and Vineeth Jacob.

696
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,720
But he doesn't have as many years
in the service as you.

697
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,560
Please put in a good word for me.
I have connections on the Government side.

698
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,640
If I could get Trivandrum,
I'd be more happy.

699
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,640
- Sir!
- Why're you late?

700
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,000
I came to see your mimicry act.

701
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,000
I was in a mimicry act of sorts!
I was presenting a report...

702
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
...before the Subramaniam Commission.

703
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
- Sir! - Sir!
- Yes?

704
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
What are you City guys doing
here in Rural limits?

705
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,920
Excuse me, Sir?

706
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,840
- Sir, may I?
- Ok....carry on.

707
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,680
- What is it?
- Sir...Alex just met...

708
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,200
-...the Poojapura jailer Sebastian
in Court.  - And?

709
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,520
He said your brother visited Murali
in jail today.

710
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,080
Around...45 minutes ago.

711
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,440
But he is at the jeweller's with my family.
They are buying gold for tomorrow.

712
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,800
No, Sir.

713
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,520
They met. And talked for around 20 minutes.

714
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,680
As he was leaving, Aravind was trying
to get an appointment...

715
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,800
...with Sessions Judge Balakrishnan.

716
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,440
Sebastian heard him speaking on the phone.

717
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,520
Oh!

718
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,680
He seemed suspicious...
about why someone on the team...

719
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,760
...would visit the convict in jail.

720
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,120
I had to make up a story to escape him.

721
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,800
He suddenly said he needed to go
somewhere and left with the car.

722
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
We took an Uber to get here.

723
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,480
Didn't he know you had all that gold
with you?

724
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,760
- Idiot! And he didn't say
where he was going? - No.

725
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,440
- What really is the matter?
- What about the girl?

726
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,440
- She's here.
- Let me talk to her.

727
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,920
- This is nice. - Sure?
- I like it! - Dia?

728
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,320
- Let me see that one.
- Got this in another colour?

729
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,800
- What is it?
- It's Ajith.

730
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,440
Ok.

731
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,640
- Hello? <i>- Do you know where Aravind went?</i>
- No.

732
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,080
<i>He didn't tell me.</i>

733
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,600
We spoke at a threatening level
at that time.

734
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,200
That's why he remained silent.
It may not be the same this time.

735
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,600
His meeting Murali in jail
two days after the verdict...

736
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,080
...and getting an appointment
with the Judge...

737
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,080
...means is something fishy going on, Sir.

738
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,440
But it's not like Aravind has any evidence
to support Murali.

739
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,600
There is a man named Chandran Pillai...
somewhere out there.

740
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,840
- Sir!
- Sir!

741
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,560
Sir!

742
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,800
The whereabouts of this man...
where he goes...

743
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,880
...who he meets...who he calls...

744
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,400
...I want every detail as it happens.

745
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,920
- With immediate effect.
- Sir!

746
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,040
Need I stress
that this is highly confidential?

747
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,880
- Need I?
- Sir!

748
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,920
Till ten minutes ago, he was under
the Pangode tower.

749
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Now he has reached the  Peyad tower.

750
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,800
Moving towards Malayinkeezhu junction.

751
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,400
The location now is the traffic signal
at Malayinkeezhu junction.

752
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,360
Sir...I am deviating now.

753
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,440
Towards Maranelloor.

754
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,000
- Mahesh is currently the Maranelloor SI,
isn't he? - Yes, Sir. - Call him.

755
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,600
Sir, he was CPO when this case happened.

756
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,240
He was on the team then.
But he didn't know the details.

757
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,560
If we suddenly say something
related to this, he might....

758
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,240
...get suspicious. And he can't be trusted
to side with us on this.

759
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,360
That's true. He could start wondering...

760
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,120
...why we are getting disturbed if we
have done nothing wrong.

761
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,440
- ASI Sajan is posted there, isn't he?
- Yes, Sir.

762
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,440
How did that get there? Hey!
Didn't you check that shelf before?

763
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,040
I did...but I didn't see....

764
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,920
Guess I accidentally...

765
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,600
September 2017...rash and negligent
driving...Chandran Pillai.

766
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,280
That is also right here.
If it isn't in TR5...

767
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,640
...it must be 'accidentally' lying at the
bottom of a shelf somewhere here.

768
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,440
- I need to get it.
- Yes, Sir!

769
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,560
Sir, his appointment
with the Sessions Judge is at 4 pm.

770
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,480
- At his residence. - He should not
leave the premises till after 4.

771
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,080
- Do whatever is necessary.
- Yes, Sir!

772
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,800
- And the address?
- They are looking.

773
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,840
I need the pages and address details
in this file...

774
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
...when I meet the judge.

775
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,920
I have nothing else to produce before him.

776
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,280
Without that adress, this case is dead.

777
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,720
If you had told me then,
what you told me today...

778
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,080
...you wouldn't have been alone in this.

779
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,720
I would have stood by you.

780
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,920
What you are as you say this today, is
what SI Aravind Karunakaran was then.

781
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,200
Doing is not as easy as saying it,
when you are a policeman.

782
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,720
Chandran Pillai...son of Soman Pillai...

783
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,800
...Karthika...House no. 24/3....

784
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,240
Crime No. 252/17.

785
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,440
- The file is there, isn't it?
- Yes, Sir.

786
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,840
Bring that file to my office.

787
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,240
- Immediately!
- Sir!

788
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,520
- Is Sajan around?
- He is, Sir.

789
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,080
Get him on the line.

790
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,360
- Sajan!
- Sir!

791
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,160
Here.

792
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,520
- Sir? - You should come along.
And the file...

793
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,600
-...should be with you the whole time.
- Yes, Sir!

794
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,160
I was told to keep this with me.

795
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,040
Sir! That's my car!

796
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,160
- Could you tell them, please?
- Can you see what's written there?

797
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,480
Sir...this wasn't here before.

798
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,920
It is now. Pay the fine at the traffic
station and you can get your car back.

799
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,440
- Sir, please! I have an emergency!
- So do we.

800
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,720
No, Sir. He is right here.

801
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,040
I wil see that he doesn't leave.

802
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,120
Sir...hope you don't mind my asking...

803
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,160
...but is there some major issue going on?

804
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,560
Sir! Sorry, Sir!

805
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,120
No, Sir...Sir...sorry, Sir!

806
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,080
I will hold him till 4, Sir.

807
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,040
Sir!

808
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,880
- What's this, man?
- The key was on it.

809
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,920
Since he is Mahesh Sir's friend,
I thought...

810
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,000
I am on the way, Sir.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

811
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,560
- The SI will get there too.
- This is a theft from station premises.

812
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,800
- 379.
- Sir...

813
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,040
...do we have a complaint from Mahesh?
It's his bike after all.

814
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,120
Just get him into custody for now. We'll
get Mahesh to write the complaint later.

815
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,680
Alright, Sir.

816
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,920
It's non-bailable.

817
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,920
So where is the evidence
for what you are saying?

818
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,760
Some of it was framed, Sir...some...

819
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,400
...I have personally planted.

820
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,880
When the chargesheet was filed and
when the Sessions Court gave its verdict...

821
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,240
...and later when the appeal came before
the High Court, where were you?

822
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,120
I tried, Sir. I had even reported
the matter to higher officials.

823
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,560
I just didn't have the courage then...
to come this far.

824
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,360
Ajith Karunakaran is your elder brother,
isn't he?

825
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,360
- Yes, Sir.
- You are the youngest? - Yes.

826
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,840
Is your family partition done?

827
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,080
I mean properties and assets.

828
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,440
I need to ask. When someone remains
silent for a long time...

829
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,560
...and then comes forward with a claim
after the matter is closed...

830
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,200
...I will need to ask
what your hidden interest is.

831
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,400
Is it money? Cheap publicity?

832
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,520
Or revenge against someone
who was on the team?

833
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,000
I will need to ask. I will need to suspect.

834
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,200
The Court is not a playground you can
walk on and off any time you please.

835
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,880
Do you have any evidence at all?
And I don't mean mere statements.

836
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,560
Solid, tangible...

837
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,320
-...evidence?
- There is, Sir!

838
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,240
As I said...Chandran Pillai...whose
offence of rash driving was compounded.

839
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,440
Then bring him. Or else...

840
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,880
...his vehicle number...address...
whereabouts...

841
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,240
The day you do that,
I will reopen this case.

842
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,520
Sir...the Vanchiyoor CI...

843
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,320
...is outside saying he needs to see you
on an urgent basis.

844
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:09,120
- Ok.
- Sir.

845
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,840
- Sir...
- What's the emergency, Joshy?

846
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,520
Sir, I just got a message
from Maranelloor station.

847
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,760
There is a complaint against this man...
for stealing...

848
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
...the SI's bike from the station premises.

849
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,200
We got information
that the suspect was in here.

850
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,720
The bike is outside.

851
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,760
Hand over the key!

852
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,840
- Check the papers and bring it over.
- Sir.

853
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,200
Come.

854
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,040
Sir!

855
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,440
The vehicle registration is in his name.

856
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,640
- Hand over the key!
- Trying to act smart?

857
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,800
Leave it, Joshy!
If I hadn't gone on leave...

858
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,400
...I would've been in your post now.
So I know.

859
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,760
- So pretty!
- Nice, isn't it?

860
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,560
Your brother dearest said
red is your favourite colour.

861
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,640
He selected this himself for you!

862
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,320
- Careful! - Look...all I have on hand
are a few shorteats.

863
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,120
That will do! Ashwin said
they can stay only for a few minuetes.

864
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
Here he is!

865
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,240
- Brother-in-law! - Hi!
- Where were you? - Cheta!

866
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,520
- Why weren't you answering the phone?
- I had to meet a friend.

867
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,000
- When he called, I just...
- In that case...

868
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,200
...you could've at least told Dia.

869
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,400
Here...you can give it to him yourself.

870
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Look! They are here!

871
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,840
- Oh! - Keep this over there!

872
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,880
(Casual conversations)

873
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,400
- Meet my favourite Uncle, Aravind
Karunakaran. - Hello! - Hi!

874
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,120
- God! I hope Uncle Ani didn't hear me!
- She talks about you all the time.

875
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,320
- Please believe only the good bits!
- Of course! - Let's click a selfie!

876
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,400
- Phone..? - Wait...Dad!

877
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,240
- We were just talking about this property.
- Dad? Phone!

878
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,280
- This was built by my Dad.
In those days... - Come on!

879
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Come.
(Conversation continues in background)

880
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,240
- Hold it higher.
- Ok.

881
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,280
Ok!

882
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,760
Oh gosh! This is Dia Didi...Uncle's...

883
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,840
I got that.

884
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,120
- Hi! - Hi!
- Uncle? - Yes? - Just us please...

885
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,440
And I have to click it?
Dia...help me frame it?

886
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,360
- Ok?
- Let me see.

887
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,720
- Is that ok?
- Yes!

888
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,920
- I will send it to you, ok?
- Ok.

889
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
You will return
right after the ring exchange?

890
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,320
- Ya! - You're going shopping tomorrow?
- Where's my phone?

891
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,680
Ya..we have plans...but nothing's decided.

892
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,280
- Make sure you get everything!
- Yes.

893
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,600
- Ok?
- After us, it will be their turn!

894
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,320
- We'll see you next time. - By the way,
you look completely at home in Trivandrum.

895
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,880
- Ok. - Let's go.
- I am really flattered, ok?

896
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,080
- Come...let's go.
- Ok.

897
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Chandran Pillai?

898
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,120
- Oh! Chandran Pillai!
- Yes.

899
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
He used to rent this house before.

900
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:26,080
I own the house.
I live here with my family now.

901
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,760
And you are Chandran Pillai Sir's...?

902
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
I know him...from a while back.

903
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We've not been in touch for a long time.

904
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
When I enquired about him,
I got this address.

905
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,120
Do you have any details?

906
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,120
Oh no! I was going to ask you that!

907
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
We've been looking everywhere for him!

908
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,280
Come in...please!

909
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,400
- Meenu!
- Yes?

910
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,000
I called on his old number...
but it was of no use.

911
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,040
He's a friend of Chandra Pillai Sir's.

912
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,120
- Your name?
- I...Anand.

913
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,200
Ok....Anand.

914
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,560
Were you together in the Navy?

915
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,760
No...I knew him...outside of the Navy.

916
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,280
- In Trivandrum...
- I was just thinking...

917
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,520
...it's unlikely you belong
to the same batch.

918
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,720
Wouldn't you have the address
in the rental agreement?

919
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Agreement? With him?

920
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,280
How could we make an agreement
with God's envoy?

921
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,440
We never took any rent from him.

922
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,760
She was 43 when she gave birth to our son.

923
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,440
And I was 46.

924
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,520
Chandran Pillai conducted prayers
and rituals for us in 6 different temples.

925
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,000
See that?
He kept it there as part of the rituals.

926
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,040
What the doctors couldn't do for us
in 15 years...

927
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,800
...he did for us with God's grace.

928
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,400
What is this?

929
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,280
- I'll bring tea.
- Ok.

930
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,280
However badly you want kids,
after an age...

931
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,320
...you need to still feel an attraction
for each other.

932
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,360
This has the magical power to...
you know...

933
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,480
...make us feel...

934
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,040
How much money did he charge you?
For all of it?

935
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,200
Actually...I also needed his help
with something like this.

936
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,160
Can you measure God's blessing
in terms of money, Anand?

937
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,400
But...I need to know if I can afford it.

938
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,440
We must have spent around 4.5 lakhs...
we would've given 10 if he had asked!

939
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,120
None of that compares with having a son!

940
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,160
- How long is it since he left?
- Three years now.

941
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,400
We were in Nagercoil at the time
that he was living here.

942
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,280
By then, he had received
a Holy Awakening...

943
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,280
...and left the Navy.

944
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,400
He hails from Kollam.

945
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,520
We made a lot of enquiries.

946
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,080
It was like he appeared here for us...
blessed us...

947
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,920
...and then disappeared...
that's how we see it.

948
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:24,200
If I solve this case, the punishment
could be up to 5 years of jail...

949
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:26,760
...for me and my brother.

950
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
It will affect everyone in the family.

951
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,080
Also you...and us.

952
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,800
I know...but Aravind...
I have learned a lot from you.

953
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:42,000
An officer who made one mistake...and felt
he did not deserve the job anymore!

954
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:45,040
That's what made you special!

955
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,920
That's why I fell in love with you.

956
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,920
What's more important? Our happiness...

957
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,320
...or the freedom of an innocent man?

958
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,880
Why so distant? This is
how people get to know each other.

959
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,080
- Hey! Hey you!
- Can't you look where you are going?

960
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,320
- It's ok...he is with us - Aravind!
Stop! - Reshma, are you ok? - Ya I am fine!

961
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,520
<i>- Don't you have eyes?
- Who do you think you are yelling at?</i>

962
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,880
- Reshma...no...stop it! - Let it go!
- No! Stop it!

963
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Shut up, woman! Is this the way to talk?

964
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,680
- Hey you!
- Can't you see people standing here?

965
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,200
(Heated argument)

966
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,600
(Argument escalates)

967
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,400
Hey Renjith! Who on earth is this guy?

968
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:49,120
Don't hit! Please don't hit!

969
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,680
Aravind! Aravind, please!

970
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,600
Aravind! No!
You are not a damn police officer anymore!

971
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,680
- The first invitation is for you, Sir!
- Thank you!

972
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,920
I couldn't make it for the engagement...
your brother said it was a grand affair.

973
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,440
Oh...

974
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,600
Its the first time I saw someone
walk in at 11 in the night...

975
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,720
...and ask to cancel his leave
to rejoin the service!

976
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,440
And when I asked if he wanted
the City unit...

977
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,440
...he specifically asked for Maranelloor!

978
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,520
The SI there, Mahesh, was open to a
mutual transfer to City...

979
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,760
...so it was easy!

980
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,040
- Oh...
- On his way to join this morning...

981
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,200
...he dropped in again to see me.

982
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,840
Hmm.

983
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,560
Someone said you rejoined the service.

984
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,440
It's a good thing!

985
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,360
Badiyadukka....in Kasargode*...
(*northern-most district of Kerala)

986
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,200
You are to join there tomorrow morning. The
SI has to be relieved on your arrival.

987
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,880
You will have to start right away.
It's quite far.

988
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,880
As far from here as possible.

989
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,040
We have people to take care of things here.

990
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,760
And better send that girl home or wherever.

991
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,440
The Department has some rules and ethics.

992
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,840
One more thing.

993
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,000
I won't be expecting you
for Malu's wedding.

994
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,280
Whoever might call you in that regard.

995
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,760
I've been transferred. To Kasargode.

996
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,880
How come so soon, Sir?

997
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:01,640
There are 5 of these.
Put one up in your shop.

998
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,440
And the rest in the main areas around
without anyone seeing you do it.

999
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:09,440
"Childless? Do not worry!
Call...Chandran Pillai"

1000
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,120
Someone asked
if he could put this up in the shop.

1001
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,640
About the rest, you know nothing,
you've seen nothing.

1002
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,800
Whoever asks, that's what you say.
Even the police.

1003
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,920
Ok.

1004
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,800
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>

1005
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,200
<i>I am calling from Maranelloor.</i>

1006
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,320
<i>-Are you Chandran Pilllai Sir?</i>
- Yes.

1007
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,720
I've been married for 8 years.

1008
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
We approached a lot of experts.

1009
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,520
Is there some treatment?

1010
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,440
- What's your name?
- Biju K George.

1011
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,720
I was in Maranelloor...
around two years ago.

1012
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,800
Oh...I didn't know, Sir!

1013
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:10,880
I knew Martin Sir... the one who got
killed...really well.

1014
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:14,720
Sir...what kind of treatment do you do?
Ayurveda or Homeo or something?

1015
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,200
No. I have some special rituals and prayers
for childless couples.

1016
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,440
I will see you and assess what you need.

1017
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,480
<i>Alright, Sir.</i>

1018
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,320
- What? - Nothing.
- How many kids do you have?

1019
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,440
- Three. - Isn't that enough?
- Yes.

1020
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,640
- Then you can carry on.
- Ok.

1021
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,440
It's put up in two or three locations.

1022
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:44,400
One is in Thampi's son's hotel.

1023
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,760
Our lads made enquiries...

1024
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,480
...and he said someone stuck it there.

1025
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,520
We don't really have a reason...

1026
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,600
...to ask in more detail.

1027
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,680
The phone number is in Aravind's name.

1028
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,760
Mahesh was also seen around the junction.

1029
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,760
Sir...maybe we could talk to Aravind again.

1030
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,040
What about? We are done with talking.

1031
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:11,200
It's just...he doesn't  seem
to have let go of this.

1032
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:15,400
He will have to step out of Kasargode
before he can investigate anything.

1033
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
I have told his superiors...

1034
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
...that he is in need of disciplining.

1035
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,240
They'll take care of him.

1036
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,840
I can't help thinking...if this gets out...

1037
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,400
...you remember what happened
to Padmanabhan Sir...

1038
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,440
A case of mistaken identity...
in a trivial incident of lock-up assault...

1039
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,640
...and he was tortured so badly!

1040
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,360
The entire family committed suicide.

1041
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:43,240
And it's not just him...
whoever got caught in cases like this...

1042
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,680
...have seen their lives land in tragedy.

1043
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,560
Exactly! If the media gets wind of this...

1044
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,640
...things will get completely out of hand!

1045
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,560
I am somehow getting by on my pension, Sir.

1046
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,880
After my by-pass surgery and treatment,
I have nothing left.

1047
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,360
I have another daughter to be married off.

1048
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,720
And my son is still a student.

1049
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,040
I am unable to stand this anxiety!

1050
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:15,480
Everytime the doorbell or phone rings...

1051
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,160
-...I feel a shiver within me!
- Hey!

1052
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,200
Stop worrying, Marar!

1053
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,400
I am here...aren't I?

1054
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,360
Sitaram Sir was asking about you.

1055
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:36,840
Whether you are discontinuing the course.

1056
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,920
I didn't say anything.

1057
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,760
How are things there....the climate?

1058
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,880
For us, it's the same climate everywhere.

1059
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,720
Mostly hot...
with the occasional bit of rain.

1060
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,880
Getting used to it.

1061
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,160
Tell Sitaram Sir...

1062
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,600
Take your time...I think you need it.

1063
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,720
Hmm.

1064
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:14,080
Sir...I loved him...I really did.

1065
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,400
- Sir! -  I... - This is the SI...
you can talk to him. - Ok.

1066
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:24,800
Sir...I was just telling them...

1067
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,760
...that I was in love with someone.
I really loved him!

1068
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,480
- Please take a look at this...the messages
he sent me. - Ok, Ok.

1069
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,120
There are 1120 messages here!

1070
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,600
And look at this..."I will...

1071
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,240
...come till the end of the world...
with you"

1072
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,800
- That means he would...
- Alright!

1073
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,120
- What's your name again?
- Jancy!

1074
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,440
- Are you married?
- Yes...

1075
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,000
My husband left me...
and this man is a widower.

1076
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,560
He works in the KSEB in Thrissur...
Deepak Menon.

1077
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,800
He said he is building a new house there
and asked for Rs. 50,000.

1078
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,040
And I sent it to him...he returned
the money to my account in a week.

1079
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,240
See? This is a photo of the house...
work is progressing on it...

1080
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,480
He said we could have the wedding
and the house warming on the same day.

1081
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,440
- Take this. - Sir! - Ten days ago,
he asked for 1 lakh rupees.

1082
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:16,440
And ever since I sent him that money,
there's been no call or message!

1083
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,760
- And you've never met him?
- No, Sir.

1084
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,600
We met through chatting...next 25th...

1085
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,040
...is my birthday and he said he would
come in person to meet me that day.

1086
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,600
- <i>Chandran Pillai?</i> - Yes?
(Jancy continues talking)

1087
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,320
<i>Know me? I am Mujeeb.</i>

1088
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,760
- I don't really...
- <i>You f**ing b*****!</i>

1089
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:39,080
- <i>If you resurface after 2 years,
you thought I wouldn't find out?</i>

1090
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,240
- <i>You destroyed my life!
Wherever you are, I will hunt you down!</i>

1091
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:44,520
Where are you calling from?

1092
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,920
Sir! I don't even have money
to pay the interest!

1093
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,480
Even if I don't get him,
I just want my money back, Sir!

1094
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,520
- Sir!
- Shut your mouth, woman!

1095
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,440
You send 1 lakh rupees and photos
to a man you have never met...

1096
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,520
...and now you are whining?

1097
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,480
Mujeeb?

1098
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,280
Dad!

1099
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,880
He said he had a golden yam
with divine powers.

1100
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,600
He said if I kept it at home for 6 months,
my daughters...

1101
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,440
...would get good alliances
and I fell for it!

1102
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,920
He took 2.5 lakh rupees from me...

1103
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
...and said he would return
with the golden yam.

1104
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,480
- I took that money on loan at cut-throat
interest! - And you  paid in cash?

1105
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,040
Yes...he seemed absolutely
trustworthy, Sir.

1106
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,320
His behaviour was impeccable! He even
stayed in our room upstairs for a while.

1107
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,760
- Got an address or something from him?
- I only know that he hailed from Kollam.

1108
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,080
He showed me an identity card too...

1109
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:13,120
At that time I did not have
the foresight...

1110
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,240
...to look at it closely or keep a copy.

1111
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,600
He had rented a house in Vithura.

1112
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,440
- But when I went in search of him,
he had already left the place. - Ok.

1113
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,360
Isn't that Martin's house?
The one who got murdered?

1114
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:38,280
- Yes.
- Being so close by...

1115
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,440
...he might also have known this man?
This Chandran Pillai?

1116
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,400
He did, Sir. I introduced them!

1117
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,080
They did not have children.
And this guy claimed...

1118
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,320
...he knew some prayers or rituals
to solve that. So I told Martin Sir.

1119
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,160
And he even performed some prayers
and rituals in their house.

1120
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,240
I am sure he duped them out of a lot
of money too!

1121
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,080
But before they knew they had been duped,
Murali killed them!

1122
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,640
He was even around during their funeral.

1123
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:17,880
- Hello?
<i>- Crime Records Bureau, Kollam District.</i>

1124
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,560
I am the SI of Badiyadukka in Kasargode.
Aravind Karunakaran.

1125
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,280
Hello, Sir.
I am Civil Police Officer Anwar.

1126
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,920
I need details about someone...
it's just a crime background checking.

1127
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,520
- Chandran Pillai.
- Sir...full name?

1128
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,320
- Unknown.
- Address?

1129
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,440
Not available.

1130
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,440
Anwar...I know nothing more about the man.

1131
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,040
Chandran Pillai.
That's the only information.

1132
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,200
Escaped your grasp or on the run?

1133
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,000
Someone who keeps slipping away!

1134
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,080
- Even this is just a hunch.
- Ok.

1135
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,720
There are 5 persons by that name.
One has been in jail for the past 3 years.

1136
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,920
Is there anything else you could specify?

1137
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:04,360
Age! He must be between 35 and 40.

1138
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,120
- That's three of them.
- What were the charges?

1139
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,400
One of them is the guy in jail
I mentioned earlier.

1140
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:14,240
That was a case of simple hurt.
Another has a charge of cheating.

1141
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,320
- In several places.
- Cheating?

1142
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,880
That's the one!

1143
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,200
You may note the address, Sir.

1144
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:24,360
- Go on.
- House number 370/2...

1145
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,440
Kandachiramukku, Kottiyam, Kollam.

1146
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,800
Anything else? About this person?

1147
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,640
No...Sir...could you hold on for a minute?

1148
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,720
OK.

1149
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,080
Ok. Thank you. Sir?

1150
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:42,440
- Yes, Anwar?
- I just checked with the Special Branch.

1151
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,840
There are no cases currently against him.
But his passport verification...

1152
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,720
...happened two weeks ago.
He is leaving for the UAE the day after.

1153
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,240
He has got a job there apparently.
If you have any evidence to detain him...

1154
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,280
I don't. I have no evidence.

1155
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,200
If this is an attempt to abscond...
you may not be able to get him hereafter.

1156
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,800
If you could get here
before he leaves, maybe...

1157
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,880
Anyway...thank you, Anwar!

1158
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,040
- Thank you so much!
- Ok, Sir!

1159
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,720
I have a personal emergency in Kollam, Sir.

1160
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,240
It's urgent. I need two days leave.

1161
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,640
I'll start right now and be back
by noon day after.

1162
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,720
Aren't you ashamed?

1163
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,200
You were on leave
for two and a half years...

1164
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,360
...and it's barely two weeks
since you rejoined.

1165
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,600
For the next one year...
whatever may be your reason...

1166
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,720
...don't even mention the word leave to me!

1167
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,440
I heard about you
all the way from Trivandrum...

1168
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:45,880
- Now get back to your duty!
- Sir!

1169
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,760
Oh...I actually was going to call you.

1170
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,640
There's a complaint against you
before the Women's Commission.

1171
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,400
About your behaviour with a complainant.

1172
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,800
Did you have some difficulty
in taking up her case?

1173
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
No, Sir...we are tracing a phone number.

1174
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,240
- As soon as we get it...
- Ok...ok...

1175
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,360
There's a sitting of the Commission
at the Town Hall today.

1176
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,440
Go there and give your explanation. Ok?

1177
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,440
Sir!

1178
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,800
- Alright.
- Come.

1179
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,760
- Did you say 'shut your mouth, woman'
to this lady? - I did.

1180
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,240
Then please apologise to her.

1181
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,720
Madam...from the date of the complaint...

1182
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:34,240
...we have been making enquiries
based on the details she provided.

1183
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,680
There is no Deepak Menon
working in the KSEB in Thrissur District.

1184
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,600
The number she gave us belongs to
a man named Ronnie who lives in Kollam.

1185
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,440
We just got his whereabouts. A message will
be sent to the Kollam Crime Squad today.

1186
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:52,480
But given the seriousness of the case, my
subordinates and I are leaving for Kollam.

1187
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:55,840
- Right now.
- That is the official side.

1188
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,480
And we really appreciate it.
But that is not the matter before us.

1189
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,560
Sorry.

1190
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,680
Ok.

1191
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,320
Hello.

1192
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,600
Ok. And the information is correct?

1193
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:33,320
Ok. I will call you if we need something
when we get there.

1194
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:35,920
Ok.

1195
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,160
- Sir? - Hmm?
- He is in the Varkala area right now.

1196
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:41,480
- He works at the beach there. I enquired
locally.  - Anyone for Kottiyam stop?

1197
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,800
I have something to do here.
Call me when you locate the guy.

1198
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,080
- I'll get there.
- Ok, Sir.

1199
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,240
- I want to get to this address.
- Ok, Sir.

1200
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,040
Chandran Pillai?

1201
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,800
Yes.

1202
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,360
The name is mine. The address is mine.

1203
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,520
And the cases registered in the police
station were in my name.

1204
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:55,040
But the person who committed those acts...

1205
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,200
...and the person you are looking for
is not me!

1206
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,520
Someone used my identity...and my name.

1207
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:06,640
He used me! I retired from the Navy
and was working at a reputed company...

1208
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,560
....as supervisor.
Do you know the charges against me?

1209
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,640
Attempt to murder...money laundering...
visa fraud...

1210
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,720
...car theft...black magic...

1211
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,280
For the past year and a half,
I've not had a life!

1212
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:20,440
I was walking in and out
of police stations and Courts.

1213
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,520
I was remanded...lost my job...

1214
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,880
But I pursued the case...and proved myself.

1215
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,480
But even after the Court was convinced...

1216
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,560
...those around us weren't!

1217
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,440
Those who were cheated by him...
came looking for Chandran Pillai...

1218
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,440
...at all hours of the day and night.

1219
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,840
Some were convinced after they saw me
in person...some not even then!

1220
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,600
Our neighbours still won't talk to us...

1221
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,680
...neither me nor my family.

1222
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,240
This is my final hope of escape.

1223
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:51,280
It's a security guard's job...
I need to pay the kids' fees...

1224
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,360
We still need to eat!
Do you want to destroy this as well?

1225
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,480
Go ahead!
Do you want to put more cases on me?

1226
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,560
Go right ahead!

1227
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,560
- Got it, Sir.
- Ask Mujeeb if this is Chandran Pillai.

1228
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,000
- Right now, if possible.
- I am at a funeral.

1229
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
Marar Chetan died...last night.

1230
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,760
He had a heart attack.

1231
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,160
He escaped...

1232
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,800
...didn't he?

1233
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,120
Mahesh?

1234
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,560
All the best!

1235
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,200
The people who came in search
of Chandran Pillai...was he among them?

1236
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:39,480
Isn't this the man who was murdered
by an auto driver?

1237
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,680
He has been here!

1238
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:44,880
He came in saying he was looking
for an address nearby.

1239
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,120
He said he wanted some water.
And asked me a lot about myself.

1240
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:50,920
And then he left...after about 5 days...

1241
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:53,080
...I read about his murder in the papers.

1242
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,080
That's why I remember.

1243
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,640
Sir...over there.

1244
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,560
So you call up women and dupe them
out of their money, do you?

1245
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,280
- Sir, these calls are not from my phone.
- Then how come the SIM is in your name?

1246
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:33,200
This number was taken for Reji Zachariah
who works in the secretariat.

1247
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,720
He said he could get me a job as a
deep sea diver and for that...

1248
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,520
...he had to make some international calls.
So I got him this number.

1249
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,000
You can find him easily - Reji Zachariah.

1250
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,160
He works in the tourism department
in the Secretariat (at Thiruvananthapuram)

1251
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:45,280
He was personally conducting
the recruitment here.

1252
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,520
I have no means of moving forward.

1253
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,560
- Dead end.
- Huh.

1254
01:47:57,920 --> 01:47:59,920
The wedding is at 10.45.

1255
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,760
Malu personally invited me...that's why...

1256
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:09,800
It's good that you came.

1257
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,720
- Please give this to her without
Chetan or Chechi knowing. - Ok.

1258
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:20,080
Whatever happens to this case,
I wil return to Kasargode this evening...

1259
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:23,080
...and everything will be back to routine.

1260
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,840
To hell with Murali!

1261
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,200
To hell with him forever!

1262
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,560
We checked the register. Reji Zachariah
is here...just as he  said...

1263
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,640
...in the tourism department.

1264
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:55,920
- Where can I find Reji Zachariah?
- 4th table over there. - Ok.

1265
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,640
Reji Zachariah?

1266
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,560
You're from the police station, right? The
SI said you were coming in the afternoon.

1267
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,800
Please sit.

1268
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:14,440
I have already said all this
in my statement at the hospital.

1269
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:17,320
I am not sure this is how to write it.
I'll read it to you.

1270
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:19,600
Please check.

1271
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,720
My name is Reji Zachariah.

1272
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,120
I work as an Upper Division Clerk
in the Secretariat.

1273
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:28,120
It was brought to my notice that for a few
weeks now, someone whom I don't know...

1274
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,280
...has been using my name
and identity to carry out job fraud.

1275
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,720
Two people who lost money in this manner...

1276
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,480
...came to the Secretariat looking for me
and that is how I came to know about this.

1277
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,800
I got the phone number from one
of those people...

1278
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,920
...and called up the fraudster saying I
needed a job. He told me...

1279
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:44,600
...to come to Pamban island
and bring Rs. 25000. He also said...

1280
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,760
...to keep it confidential
as  it was a back-door appointment.

1281
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,880
Thus I made my way to the island.

1282
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:11,680
Sir...look at that house...

1283
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,840
- That new one...
- The one with the lights? - Yes.

1284
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,400
Look at this, Sir.

1285
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,760
The photo he sent to Jancy.

1286
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:25,800
That means he is somewhere close.

1287
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,080
I didn't tell anyone...
I came alone in a small boat.

1288
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:56,280
I was also carrying a small knife...
just in case.

1289
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,440
I wanted to know who he was
and why he was using my name.

1290
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,520
I waited here for about half an hour.

1291
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:06,920
And then he came.

1292
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,120
He wasn't just arriving...he came
out of wherever he was already hiding here.

1293
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,240
All that while he was watching me.

1294
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,800
He understood who I was
and why I had come.

1295
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:21,240
As soon as I asked who are you,
he sprayed pepper spray on my face.

1296
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,640
I was rolling on the ground,
unable to open my eyes.

1297
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:37,000
He hit me on the head
with something like an iron rod.

1298
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:40,680
He hit me a couple of times
and I lost consciousness.

1299
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:44,360
See? You can still see the traces
of blood here.

1300
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,680
When I opened my eyes,
I was under the mud here...

1301
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,800
He thought I was dead
and pushed me into the mud.

1302
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:17,080
Some women who were picking
clams saw me and brought help.

1303
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
That's why I survived.

1304
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,640
He is smart, Sir.
Don't you feel a stench here?

1305
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,800
Come with me.

1306
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:40,520
He killed a dog and put the body here...
anyone passing by would think...

1307
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,800
...the stench is from this
and a dead body would go unnoticed.

1308
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:53,160
What does he look like?

1309
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Very fair...tall...

1310
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,040
...and well-built.

1311
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,320
There was a long scar on his hand
like a knife wound.

1312
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:10,600
<i>He must be above 6 feet tall.</i>

1313
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:13,920
Very fair....very strong build...

1314
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,200
...and thick eyebrows...

1315
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,720
And then there was this...

1316
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:20,920
...scar on his left arm...

1317
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,080
...like he got stitches or something.

1318
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:25,120
He said he got that from an accident.

1319
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:57,120
They had a housewarming ceremony ten days
ago...it belongs to a guy called Srinath.

1320
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,360
He has gone for a trip with his family.

1321
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:02,680
Show me the pic.

1322
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,720
Here.

1323
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:36,840
This pic wasn't clicked from here.

1324
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,440
Sir...

1325
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,400
- Check in the crime drive...quick!
- Ok.

1326
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:38,040
Sir...in crime drive, this number is not
registered for a bike.

1327
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,280
It belongs to an i10 model car.

1328
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,280
Who are you?

1329
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:13,520
Police!

1330
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:17,440
- Who are you?
- I live in the house behind...

1331
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,720
- I am the caretaker for this house.
- Who lives here?

1332
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:23,120
Excise Officer Vinaymohan.

1333
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,160
He has rented the place.

1334
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
- And where is he?
- He is visiting back home.

1335
02:00:28,920 --> 02:00:30,920
Somewhere up north.

1336
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:34,640
- When did he say he'd be back?
- Either Sunday or Wednesday.

1337
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:38,040
He did not return on Sunday
so he will definitely get here tomorrow.

1338
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:41,240
- And he usually returns when he  says
he will? - Yes...usually before noon.

1339
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:44,200
- Who does this house belong to?
- They live abroad.

1340
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,880
When the owner died,
his children asked me...

1341
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,640
-...to find a tenant.
- Get the rental agreement.

1342
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:53,760
- There is no agreement.
- What about identity proof?

1343
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:57,280
- I don't have it. - If you are lying,
I will break your bloody neck!

1344
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:00,120
He pays in cash.

1345
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:02,880
The owner's kids said
I could keep the rent...

1346
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,920
-...as payment for looking after the place.
So I did not... - Sir!

1347
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:24,440
Which of these is him?

1348
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:34,280
None of these, Sir.

1349
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:42,120
Tall...fair...

1350
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:46,640
-...with a scar on his left arm?
- Yes...that's him!

1351
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,840
That is Vinaymohan Sir!

1352
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,240
Martin and Sheeba wanted a child.

1353
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:14,080
Mujeeb was looking for a way
out of his problems.

1354
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,000
Jancy wanted a companion and
Ronnie wanted a job.

1355
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,080
All the victims had a common factor...

1356
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:22,200
...helplessness!

1357
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:24,280
That's what he targeted.

1358
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,880
Just so he could live and die
in this manner.

1359
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,600
Like any other fraudster.

1360
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,520
But you said...

1361
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:44,040
- ...Martin went
in search of Chandran Pillai. - Yes.

1362
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So did Reji Zachariah.

1363
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:49,120
To Pamban island.

1364
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,400
- Hmm
- They both found out his identity.

1365
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:56,440
And he knew what to do
with people who did that.

1366
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:58,800
Same plan...same modus operandi.

1367
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And we are led...to some Murali somewhere.

1368
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:07,520
- What now?
- I need your bike.

1369
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:11,200
According to the old man,
he'll get here in the morning.

1370
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,800
He's dangerous.

1371
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:16,200
I will meet the local SI early in the
morning and ask for backup support.

1372
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:25,720
When they transferred me 600 kms away...

1373
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:28,840
...neither they, nor I knew...

1374
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:33,120
...that the distance would bring me
right back where I started.

1375
02:03:37,320 --> 02:03:39,320
To tie all the evidence together,
we now need...

1376
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,240
...his statement...

1377
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,360
...his name...

1378
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
...his face.

1379
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,880
- One of you inside...one of you here.
And don't let the old man go. - Sir!

1380
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:12,880
The SI isn't here. He's at
the crematorium regarding a case.

1381
02:04:13,360 --> 02:04:15,800
- If you can wait...
- Where is the crematorium?

1382
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:19,440
Turn left and go straight...
it's just half a kilometre from here.

1383
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:21,560
Ok. I will meet him there.

1384
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:23,600
You are Ajith Sir's brother, aren't you?

1385
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:26,200
- Yes.
- I know him well.

1386
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:29,160
If he needs anything in these parts,
I am the one he calls.

1387
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,480
We're done here. We'll be back soon.

1388
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,640
- The SI?
- Over there.

1389
02:04:56,360 --> 02:04:59,240
- Come.
- November 2nd, 2019...

1390
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:02,120
...Saturday...early in the morning...
the dead body was discovered...

1391
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:04,680
...at Kavalkkinar highway,
run over by an unidentified vehicle.

1392
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,680
6 feet 2 inches tall...fair complexion...

1393
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,880
...weighing 94 kgs...

1394
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,920
...looking to be
between 35 and 40 years old...

1395
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,640
...the body was found to have a birthmark
behind his neck...

1396
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:19,360
...and a long scar on his left arm.

1397
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,720
<i>- He had a leather purse with some money...</i>
- Sir...he wants to meet you. - Ok.

1398
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,760
<i>...and some visiting cards.</i>

1399
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:27,560
- Can I help you?
- Other details are not available.

1400
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,440
- Who died?
- We don't know.

1401
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:33,040
The body was in the mortuary
for the past 4 or 5 days.

1402
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:35,120
We had given it in the papers too.

1403
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:38,000
Do you have his name? Or any other detail?

1404
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,480
His phone was damaged in the accident.

1405
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,560
His wallet had some money
and around 10 visiting cards.

1406
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,360
The card said Excise Officer Vinaymohan.

1407
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,440
But we found that he is a different person.

1408
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:51,440
You are...?

1409
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,480
- I am the SI of Badiyadukka in Kasargode.
- Oh.

1410
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:55,600
I was wondering if this man was
connected to a case I was after.

1411
02:05:56,680 --> 02:05:59,160
- Do you have a photograph or something?
- Being early in the morning...

1412
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:02,040
...several vehicles ran over the body
after he was knocked down.

1413
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:05,160
The body was too mangled to be identified.

1414
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:07,480
- Bibin! - Sir?
- Come here.

1415
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:34,680
Anything else that I can...Hello?
Hello, Sir...

1416
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,720
Sir...yes, Sir...yes...

1417
02:07:51,680 --> 02:07:53,680
So you found a lot of names...

1418
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:55,680
...but not the person.

1419
02:07:55,720 --> 02:07:59,400
As long as you don't have the person,
this means nothing.

1420
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:01,640
Try harder!

1421
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,760
I'll get to the person.

1422
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:09,000
He's in Mangalore.
Near the St. Aloysius chapel...

1423
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,760
...in some hotel.
According to the information I have...

1424
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,080
...he's going to be there
for the next couple of days.

1425
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:19,120
I am going there tomorrow. It didn't feel
right to go without telling you.

1426
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:22,200
Although I have no obligation
to do so anymore.

1427
02:08:24,240 --> 02:08:26,480
I'll leave in the morning...
I won't wait to say goodbye to anyone.

1428
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:50,120
- Sir?
- Pramod...

1429
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:52,280
...that guy you got for drunken driving...

1430
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:54,440
-...can you still recognise him?
- Why do you ask, Sir?

1431
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:56,480
Just tell me...if you see him,
can you recognise him?

1432
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:59,520
- I can. - Get Alex and come here.

1433
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:02,440
We need to go to Mangalore...right away!

1434
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:05,080
To Mangalore? What's going on, Sir?

1435
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:07,520
- Just come! I'll tell you!
- Ok, Sir.

1436
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,440
What are you doing?

1437
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:29,120
Pack me the essentials for two days.

1438
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:31,160
- I need to go somewhere.
- Now?

1439
02:09:32,920 --> 02:09:34,920
Where are you going at this hour?

1440
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,720
Ashwin and Malu are leaving tomorrow.

1441
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Just do as you are told!

1442
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:30,080
- Hello?
- State Special Branch?

1443
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,760
- Who are you? - Without knowledge or
consent of the State Police Department...

1444
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:36,600
...three police officers are on the way
to Mangalore for an investigation.

1445
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,880
Their journey is regarding a case in which
the High Court already gave its verdict.

1446
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:42,600
They're carrying important documents
related to that case.

1447
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:45,320
- What is your name?
- They will reach Kasargode by noon.

1448
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:49,680
Honda Amaze...Silver Metallic...
KL01 CL8793

1449
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:53,440
The names of the officers are:
DySP Ajith Karunakaran...

1450
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:56,520
...CI Alex Koruth...SI Pramod Peter.

1451
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,920
They've crossed, Sir.

1452
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:47,560
- Ajith?
- Yes.

1453
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:50,160
- Alex, Pramod?
- Yes, I am Alex.

1454
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:52,280
- Pramod.
- Ok. Where are you going?

1455
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,280
Who are you?

1456
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,080
SSB.

1457
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:03,080
State Special Branch.

1458
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:07,440
- What's this about?
- Are you on your way to Mangalore?

1459
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:09,680
This is a personal trip...

1460
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:11,720
...to Mookambika.

1461
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:14,320
- Open the boot.
- Hey! No!

1462
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,280
Tell me what this is about! I am a DySP!

1463
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:23,440
- I need to know! - Don't make a fuss.
We are doing our job.

1464
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,560
- We have orders! - Please move.
- Come on!

1465
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,440
Call your superior! I will talk to them!

1466
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:34,240
Please!

1467
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:47,360
Open it.

1468
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:00,080
- Investigation file?
- Yes.

1469
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,280
Why do you have this on a personal trip?

1470
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:06,040
There are some facts we need to find
regarding this case.

1471
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:09,160
So this is not personal...
it is official, isn't it?

1472
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,360
This is a case that has been disposed
by the Court.

1473
02:13:14,040 --> 02:13:16,040
We are carrying out further investigation.

1474
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:19,160
Is the court order for that in here?

1475
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:24,160
Does the State Police Department
know about this?

1476
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,040
Please come with us.

1477
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:47,120
The Judge will call for you. Please wait.

1478
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,600
You've won,  haven't you?

1479
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:59,440
You have the confession.
The suspect is within reach.

1480
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:03,280
What more do you need?

1481
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,280
Just say that the findings
are all your own...

1482
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:15,880
...and you can be an approver.

1483
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:18,080
Totally free!

1484
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:25,440
Smart guy!

1485
02:14:31,120 --> 02:14:33,120
If anyone is turning approver,
it'll be all of us.

1486
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:35,240
If we are to be punished,
that will also be all of us together.

1487
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:37,440
After all we did everything together.

1488
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:40,880
And in any case, we did not just do it.
We were made to do it.

1489
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:44,120
The political party and our bosses!

1490
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:50,040
I never wanted to win
and move up all by myself...

1491
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:53,200
...not to this minute!

1492
02:14:56,760 --> 02:15:00,920
That file contains findings of the
investigation team led by Ajith Karunakaran

1493
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,800
That's what my statement will be.

1494
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:05,840
That's what all our statements should be.

1495
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:13,160
You're my hero.

1496
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:16,240
I will never let you be dragged down.

1497
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:24,200
You've been asked to come in with the file.

1498
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:31,920
There'll be an addition to the file.

1499
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:34,320
The culprit in the Martin-Sheeba murder
case is not alive.

1500
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:36,440
He's dead.

1501
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,040
He was cremated as an unclaimed body
by the police in Mayyanad.

1502
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:45,360
We don't have a name
or any other information.

1503
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,720
That's my final finding.

1504
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:57,480
OUR final finding!

1505
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:01,800
This wasn't because I wanted to win.

1506
02:16:02,200 --> 02:16:04,200
It was so Murali wouldn't lose.

1507
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:14,440
- Come.
- Yes, come on.

1508
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,000
Come.

1509
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:33,600
He died on the 2nd of November.
Last evening, Murali was released.

1510
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,920
Did you meet him?

1511
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,400
- No. - When will you reach?
- I drove via Kasargode.

1512
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:43,640
I have vacated the quarters.
I also needed to get some of my stuff.

1513
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:47,160
I've crossed the border.
I should be there by morning tomorrow.

1514
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:50,920
Ok. The Dean said he'd mailed you.

1515
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:53,400
I saw something. I haven't opened it.

1516
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:55,480
Just take a look
and reply before you reach.

1517
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:59,120
It was regarding course requirements
and some deadlines.

1518
02:16:59,360 --> 02:17:01,360
Basically asking about your plans.

1519
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:04,760
Plans! For now it is suspension...

1520
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:07,360
...then there will be an enquiry...
dismissal...

1521
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:09,560
...and then the sentence.

1522
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:15,320
Some of the joys of life
may no longer exist.

1523
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:18,440
I don't know what the future will be.

1524
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:21,120
But far more than when I had
those joys and future...

1525
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:24,440
...I feel free now.

1526
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:27,680
After a long time...I slept well!

1527
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:20,280
(reads) "I know you are right behind me..."

1528
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:22,360
"...and you know I am within your reach..."

1529
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:24,800
"...You may be a smart policeman..."

1530
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,840
"...But I am an even smarter thief!..."

1531
02:18:27,240 --> 02:18:29,240
"...so if I ever stand
across the road from you..."

1532
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:31,760
"...I will know who you are...but..."

1533
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:33,920
"...you will not know who I am..."

1534
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
"...and as long as you don't,
I will keep on living..."

1535
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:39,800
"...yours faithfully, Chandran Pillai...
Benoy Varghese...Deepak Menon..."

1536
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:42,160
"...Navas Mohammad...Radhakrishnan..."

1537
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:44,640
"...any one among hundreds of names..."

1538
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:58,840
October 30!

1539
02:19:17,640 --> 02:19:19,640
The letter you sent me before your death.

1540
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,680
But when you wrote this,
you didn't realise...

1541
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:24,840
...that having lived your life
using the names of others...

1542
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:28,440
...you would die nameless.

1543
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:32,440
And that the only one to witness
your end...would be Aravind Karunakaran.
